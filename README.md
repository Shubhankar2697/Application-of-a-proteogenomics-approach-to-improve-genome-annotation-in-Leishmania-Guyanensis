# Application-of-a-proteogenomics-approach-to-improve-genome-annotation-in-Leishmania-Guyanensis
This repository contains all scripts, helper functions, and workflow documentation used for the proteogenomic re-annotation of Leishmania guyanensis. 
In this study, we applied a proteogenomics strategy integrating high-resolution mass spectrometry data with a custom six-frame translated database to refine the genome annotation of L. guyanensis strain. Using constrained 1% FDR searches, we identified 653 genome search-specific peptides (GSSPs) that mapped to previously unannotated loci. These peptides revealed 65 novel protein-coding genes and corrected 62 existing gene models, including N- and C-terminal extensions.
This repository provides the key scripts used to:

Generate six-frame translated ORFs from the genome

Match identified peptides against protein databases

Support the discovery of novel ORFs and genome annotation refinement
